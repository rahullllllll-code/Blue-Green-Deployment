   # Blue-Green Deployment with Docker Compose
This project demonstrates a Blue-Green Deployment strategy for a simple containerized web application using Docker Compose. The goal is to deploy the next version of the application in a separate container and switch traffic only when the new version is ready. Additionally, this setup simulates a basic CI/CD pipeline with Docker Compose.

# Features
Blue-Green Deployment: Deploy a new version of the application in a separate container and switch traffic once the new version is ready.
Docker Compose: Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
Simulated CI/CD: Automate the deployment process using Docker Compose.
# Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

1) Docker and Docker Compose
2) A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for editing files.
## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine or create a new directory for the project.
```bash

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-directo
2. Create Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile to define the application container. The sample file below sets up a Python Flask app.
3. Create Docker Compose File
Create the docker-compose.yml file for defining the services (app and test).
4. Build and Run the Application
Once the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are set up, run the following command to build and start the services:
5. Verify the Deployment
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser. You should see the web app's "Hello, World!" response.
